Programming Paradigms:
1. Procedural
2. OOP

OOP: Objects encapsulate behaviours and data

Three Principles of OOPS:
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

Encapsulation: Data Members and Member Functions

-> One of three primary Principles Of OOPS
-> unites behaviours and data into Object

Encapsulation Provides:
1. SECURITY:
    information hiding
    data is protected from outside world

2. PORTABILITY

-> Class acts as a blueprint for an object.

Seperate Compliation:
-> Specification file (.h)
    contains prototypes and data members
-> Implementation file (.cpp) 
    function definitions for member functions

Compliation Line should be:
g++ main.cpp House.cpp {2 files}
and to execute ./a.out
